# UnOrganised
Unorganised provides organized ways to explore and directly contact Local Service Providers in your vicinity. The â€œUnorganised" app  will provide a platform  for the unorganized sector to tie up with us free of cost and directly connect to the end customers who might need services  in their daily lives be it handyman services like plumbing , carpenter services or specialized  services like  wedding planners.

A C2C Model enables a good working relationship model between the customer and the unorganized sector with minimal costs and also helps the customers avail services at a reasonable cost with no hidden charges.

Users can register as a Service User (i.e. person who wants to avail a service) or as a Service Professional (i.e. person who provides  a service) or as both.
